With the diversification of the game market, the methods used by black and gray industry of gaming are also becoming more diverse. Games such as SLG and MMO are frequently targeted by black and gray studios because they can be used to make money directly or have trading systems.<!-- more -->

Black and gray industry studios are organisations that rely on special equipment to play games, obtain in-game coins, items, rewards and other resources through abnormal means, and then monetise these resources through trading or transfer. Their actions have a serious impact on the economic system of games and damage the interests of game manufacturers.

As the scale of the black and gray industry grows and technology iterates, the difficulty of combating these studios has risen sharply. Studios can deploy large-scale operations quickly using methods like multi-instance group control or cloud phones, and they have the flexibility to deploy online, allowing them to swiftly transfer profits. This requires game security products to have higher detection efficiency.

Script privatisation further complicates detection. Studios incorporate social interactions or rest periods into their scripts to mimic normal players and evade detection. Distinguishing studios from normal players based on gameplay behaviour requires game security products to have more precise detection capabilities.

Additionally, samples collected by JikGuard reveal that some studios use proxies or VPNs to forge IP addresses, and even forge device fingerprints, making it difficult for conventional detection methods to track them, posing a significant technical challenge to game security products.

Game black and gray industry studios plunder game resources, causing prices and gold coins to depreciate, which seriously damages the game's economic system. Not only does this harm the interests of the official game operators, but it also causes the loss of normal paying players and shortens the game's life cycle.

In response to the problem of black and gray industry studios facing games, JikGuard has developed an exclusive protection solution that can effectively solve the problem of the proliferation of game studio accounts.
 
**Situation awareness features**

JikGuard's exclusive solution can intelligently analyse and mine featureless private scripts, locate and mark studio accounts, and automatically connect with the game provider to block accounts, achieving efficient protection.
 
**Behaviour detection solution**

JikGuard has developed a behaviour detection solution for in-game idle scripts, which is paired with a 300+ dimensional intelligent perception system to accurately identify studio accounts.
 
**Security environment detection**

It uses low-level detection methods to accurately identify the game's operating environment, such as jailbreak, ROOT, virtual machines, virtual frameworks, cloud phones, etc., and provides customised crush strategies.
