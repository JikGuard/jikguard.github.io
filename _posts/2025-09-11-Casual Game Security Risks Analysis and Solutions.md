In recent years, the mobile game market has experienced rapid growth. The lightweight design of casual games is well-suited for mobile gaming, making them ideal for filling spare time, and as a result, they have gained significant market attention and player favour.<!-- more -->

While casual games continue to grow rapidly, they also face a variety of security issues. JikGuard has compiled and analysed several case studies.
 
**● Memory modification cheats**

The principle behind this type of cheat is to use a modifier to search and locate the game memory, and then modify the value module to modify the coins/diamonds in the game to achieve no consumption and rapid cultivation, which has a great impact on the fairness of the game.

Modify the coins required to purchase goods to achieve cultivation without consumption

**● Speed hack**

The principle behind this type of cheat is to modify the obtained system time or call the time within the game engine to accelerate the flow of time within the game, achieving rapid cultivation and destroying the balance of the game.

Modify the obtained system time to skip the cultivation cycle

**● Game hacking**

Hackers can use tools to remove the game package signature, then use decompilation methods to tamper with the logic within the game, remove or implant parts of the module, and finally repackage it to produce a hacked version of the game, an ad-free version, etc., which will seriously shorten the game's life cycle.

In addition, hacking game packages also faces the risk of leaking in-game art, music, code and other resources, which can lead to very serious consequences if copied by competing products.

JikGuard has customized a special response strategy to address the risks of cheats, acceleration, and hacking faced by casual games. This solution has been integrated into many popular games and has proven its excellent protection capabilities.
 
**Anti-hacking features**

JikGuard's exclusive API-free signature verification technology deeply encrypts the game engine and code, and performs multiple checks on the game package signature and file integrity to prevent malicious modules from being implanted in the game and to remove advertisements.
 
**Anti-cheat features**

In response to the risks of game modification posed by cheats, JikGuard has developed a behaviour detection solution that, combined with a 300+ dimensional intelligent perception system, can detect all types of cheats and their variants for effective protection.
 
**Speed hack crush feature**

Using more low-level detection methods and extensive real-machine testing, any speed hacks and their variants can be detected, and the game will be immediately crushed once a speed hack is detected.
