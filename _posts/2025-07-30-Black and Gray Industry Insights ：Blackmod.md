Cases of a popular game hacked on the platform

In addition to a large number of Android game hacks, there are also boards within the Android Republic platform that target cheating on the iOS side of games. According to the investigation, it contains a large number of solutions and techniques for jailbreak cheating, as well as tools to share the use of other means to achieve cheating in non-jailbreak mode.

For a game, the consequences of being hacked are very serious. This means that the game's code logic and resource files will be analysed and tampered with by hackers, and the outgoing hacked version will attract a large number of players to cheat, destroying the fairness of the game and causing a large number of genuine players to lose, and there is also a possibility that the game's code and art resources will be stolen and spoiled.

JikGuard has developed a mature and robust anti-cheat solution that effectively protects games against hacks, cheats, and other security threats. Its integration into several popular titles has proven its outstanding protection capability.
 
**Anti-Cheat Features**
JikGuard has developed a behavior-based detection solution to address a wide range of cheats and game modification threats. Powered by an intelligent sensing system with over 300 detection dimensions, it effectively neutralizes various cheat types and their variants, delivering comprehensive and reliable protection.
  
**Anti-Hack Features**
JikGuard's exclusive API-Signature-Free Verification Technology deeply encrypts the game's engine and code, and performs multiple checks on game package signatures and file integrity, greatly reducing the possibility of being bypassed and preventing the game from being implanted with malicious modules, removing advertisements, and other behaviours.
  
**Proactive Malicious Module Detection Mechanism**
Unlike other security products on the market that rely on obtaining cheat samples to respond, JikGuardâ€™s proprietary Proactive Malicious Module Detection Mechanism can actively identify suspicious modules within the game. Combined with real-time countermeasures, it enables a proactive defense approach that significantly shortens the cheat detection cycle.
 
**Security Environment Detection**
JikGuard leverages low-level detection mechanisms to accurately identify the operating environment of the game, such as jailbreak, ROOT, virtual machine, virtual framework, cloud phone, etc., and provides customized crush policies.
