In today's gaming market, mobile games have dominated the market. However, due to factors such as screen size, lagging and performance limitations, mobile games have gradually started to support interoperability between multiple devices. However, there are still some games that are not interoperable between mobile and PC, do not support PC, or do not have a Mac version, which makes it inconvenient to experience the game on Mac devices, and PlayCover was developed to solve this problem.<!-- more -->  

PlayCover is an assistive software that can run iOS programs on macOS, bypassing the Mac App Store's censorship and installing iOS Apps on Mac devices in the form of IPA files, with keyboard shortcut mapping, mouse operation mapping, and export/import features.

We can understand PlayCover as an “emulator” for Mac devices, after installing PlayCover on a Mac device, click “Add App” to select the IPA file you want to import, and PlayCover will perform a series of signature, modification and other functions on the App. After installing PlayCover on your Mac device, click “Add App” and select the IPA file you want to import, PlayCover will sign and modify the App, and install a series of auxiliary tools such as PlayTools, and then you can play the game normally.

Installing iOS Apps with PlayCover

PlayCover itself has a very low threshold, the only difficulty is how to get the IPA file of the game you want to install.

Normally, iOS Apps are protected by Apple's encryption, which makes it impossible to directly access or modify their code and resource files. This ensures the security of the application and prevents it from being tampered with, reverse engineered, or pirated by hackers.

IPA files, on the other hand, are created by hacking iOS Apps. After hacking, the App's code and resource files are decrypted and can be viewed, modified and analyzed, and can be installed and run on non-jailbroken devices.

PlayCover community downloads decrypted iOS App IPA installers

In order to further lower the threshold of use, PlayCover software has a built-in communication community with abundant decrypted IPA resources, search for keywords in the community channel to find the corresponding IPA files, and download them to your Mac device to install with PlayCover.

Although PlayCover brings convenience to running games on Mac devices, there are some security risks. The hacked IPA file contains a large number of game codes and resource files, which, when combined with the installation of some cheats and modifiers, greatly lowers the threshold of cheating in games, and may jeopardize the fairness of games.

**JikGuard has developed a mature and complete protection solution for the game cheating problem arising from the installation of PlayCover on Mac devices, and has accessed a number of popular games and verified its excellent protection ability.**
 
**➤ Anti-Debugging Protection**
Dual protection, first using ptrace, syscall, sysctl, exception and other detection methods, and then encrypt the protection code for better results.
 
**➤ Anti-jailbreak protection**
Multi-dimensional comprehensive detection, such as checking the installation of certain Apps, the existence of files, directory access rights, etc. to comprehensively determine whether the jailbreak.
 
**➤ Anti-Resignature Protection**
Accurately verifies signatures within the package, using signatures stored at the time of hardening and comparing them with those obtained at runtime.
 
**➤ Anti-Modifier Protection**
In the code counter protection stage, JikGuard provides local detection of the code and protects its validity.
 
In addition, JikGuard has developed online feature update detection features, which can be used to issue features at the first time after acquiring samples, protecting the security of the App in the shortest possible time.
