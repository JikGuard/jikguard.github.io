Private servers refer to instances where game servers are hacked, with hackers reverse-engineering and modifying game servers to alter in-game values such as character progression, item drops, and combat rewards. They then connect their self-hosted servers to client ports to establish private servers for the purpose of generating substantial profits.<!-- more -->

Private servers exploit promotional tactics like discounted top-ups and unlimited resources to lure legitimate paying players, directly harming the game developer's revenue. Furthermore, the emergence of private servers indicates code leaks. Within the Game Black/Gray Industry supply chain, this compromised code can be exploited by other hackers to create and sell hacks, posing risks of plagiarism by competing products.
