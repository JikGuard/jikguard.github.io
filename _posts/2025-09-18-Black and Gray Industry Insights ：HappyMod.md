Game black and gray industry has always been a chronic problem plaguing the gaming industry, and some websites and communities that specialise in providing cheats and hacking resources have exacerbated this problem. This article provides an overview of the game hacking platform HappyMod, revealing its operating model and potential harms.<!-- more -->

HappyMod is a software that provides hacked games for Android users. According to observations, HappyMod has millions of daily active users and provides more than 300,000 hacked games for free download. It also implants features such as unlimited coins, modified menus, god mode, ad removal, and speed hack based on the gameplay, including many popular games that we are familiar with.

These games were hacked and had a large number of modification features implanted. In addition, the games uploaded to this hacking platform are completely free, with no additional barriers, attracting a considerable number of users to download hacked games.

Unlike other hacking communities, HappyMod also has its own APP, which divides the uploaded hacked games into categories based on game play types, user location, download popularity, and other factors, further lowering the threshold for use and attracting more users to use hacked versions.

In addition, HappyMod has an active community environment where users can upload and download new hacked games, and many cheaters communicate with each other and post requests for help, causing hacked games to spread rapidly within the community and causing serious consequences.

For a game, the consequences of being hacked are very serious. This means that the code logic and resource files within the game will be analysed and tampered with by hackers, and the leaked hacked version will attract a large number of players to cheat, destroying the fairness of the game and causing a large loss of genuine players. In addition, there is also the possibility of the code and art resources within the game being stolen and spoiled.

In response to the cheats, hacks and other risks faced by games, JikGuard has developed a mature and comprehensive protection solution, which has been integrated into a number of popular games and proven to be highly effective.
 
**Anti-cheat features**  

In response to the risks of a series of cheat modifications faced by games, JikGuard has devoted itself to the research and development of a "behaviour detection solution" that can detect various types of cheats and their variants to provide effective protection.
 
**Anti-hack features**  

JikGuard's industry-exclusive "API signature verification technology" deeply encrypts the game engine and code, and performs multiple verifications on the game package signature and file integrity, greatly reducing the possibility of being bypassed and preventing the game from being implanted with malicious modules, removing advertisements, and other behaviours.
 
**Security environment detection**  

It uses low-level detection methods to accurately identify the game's operating environment, such as jailbreak, ROOT, virtual machines, virtual frameworks, cloud phones, etc., and provides customized crush strategies.
