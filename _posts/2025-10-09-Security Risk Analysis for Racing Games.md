In racing games, real-time interaction between players involves a large amount of data processing. To avoid overloading the game server and ensure smooth gameplay, this processing is handled by the client, with the server only responsible for transmitting commands.<!-- more -->

A large amount of game data is stored locally, making the security situation for racing games even more severe. JikGuard has compiled some cases and analysed their principles.
 
**● Speed hacks**

Speed hacks work by modifying the acquired system time or calling the time within the game engine to speed up the flow of time within the game, thereby accelerating the game and disrupting its balance.

**● Memory modification cheats**

The principle of memory modification cheats is to search and locate the game memory with a modifier, and then modify the value module.

There are many dimensions that can be modified, such as the speed of nitrogen collection in the game, the value of racing car attributes, the number of items, etc., thereby achieving cheat features such as rapid gas collection, unlimited items, and reduced collision speed, which have a great impact on the fairness of the game.

**● Game hacking**

Hackers use decompilation to tamper with the logic within the game, remove or implant parts of the module, and finally repackage it to create a pirated or hacked version of the game. In addition, hackers use a variety of covert means to bypass game verification and disguise it as a genuine game.

If a game is hacked, pirated and hacked versions and accompanying cheats will quickly spread through various channels, seriously shortening the game's life cycle.

JikGuard has customised a special response strategy to address the risks of acceleration, cheats and hacking faced by racing games. This solution has been integrated into many popular games and has proven its excellent protection capabilities.
 
**Speed hack crush feature**

Using more low-level detection methods and extensive real-machine testing, it can detect any speed hack and its variants. Once a speed hack is detected, the game will immediately crash.
 
**Anti-cheat feature**

In response to the risks of a series of cheat modifications that games face, JikGuard has developed a behaviour detection solution, combined with a 300+ dimensional intelligent perception system, which can effectively protect against all types of cheats and their variants.
 
**Anti-hacking feature**

JikGuard's exclusive API-Signature-Free Verification Technology deeply encrypts the game's engine and code, and performs multiple checks on game package signatures and file integrity, preventing the game from being implanted with malicious modules, removing advertisements, and other behaviours.
