Due to the complex operating environment of PC clinets, cheats can obtain higher privileges to cheat, and the security issues faced by games are more serious than those faced by mobile devices.<!-- more -->

According to observations, PC game cheats often use a combination of static analysis and dynamic debugging to find weaknesses in the game code logic, thereby creating cheats and hacks.

In this article, we will focus on analysing the principles and solutions of the OllyDbg dynamic debugger and its variants.

OllyDbg is a 32-bit assembly/analysis debugger with a visual interface that can run on various versions of Windows. With its powerful disassembly engine, it can perform analysis and debugging without source code and is often used to hack games and create cheats.

Ollydbg operation interface

OllyDbg combines dynamic debugging and static analysis with a visual interface, lowering the threshold for use and making it quite flexible for tracking and handling exceptions.

OllyDbg can recognise thousands of functions frequently used by C and Windows, annotate their parameters, and automatically analyse strings in function process loop statements, which greatly helps with game cheating.

In addition, OllyDbg also adopts an open design, with an open plug-in interface and external script execution features. With the development of many hackers, OllyDbg's features have become increasingly powerful.

Since OllyDbg only supports the x86 architecture and cannot decompile 64-bit applications, x64dbg was born.

Based on Ollydbg, x64dbg supports both x86 and x64 architectures. Furthermore, x64dbg is an open source project with an improved plug-in system and more powerful features, such as memory mapping, data tracking, and disassembly.

X64dbg user interface

Due to the complexity of PC game cheating, solving game security issues is a comprehensive test of the features of game hardening products. JikGuard provides mature and comprehensive customised solutions for PC game security issues. This protection solution has been integrated into many popular games and has proven its excellent protection capabilities.
 
**Anti-debugging features**

Prevents cheats from debugging the game and blocks static or dynamic analysis of the game. Once debugging and analysis tools such as Ollydbg/x64dbg are detected, the game immediately crashes.
 
**Anti-hacking features**

JikGuard uses fully self-developed virtualisation and shelling technology to deeply encrypt the game engine, code and resources, protecting the game code and preventing tampering.
 
**Anti-cheat features**

An anti-cheat solution covering all PC game scenarios, including injection interception, anti memory modification, anti speed hack and many other features, effectively protecting against all types of cheats and their variants.
 
**Anti virtual environment**

JikGuard's exclusive solution can accurately identify various types of virtual environments. Once a virtual environment is detected, it can immediately crush or report it for processing.
  
**Communication protocol protection**

JikGuard provides data verification features that can accurately verify game uplink and downlink data, ensuring the security of game communication protocols and avoiding packet intercept cheats and private server issues.
