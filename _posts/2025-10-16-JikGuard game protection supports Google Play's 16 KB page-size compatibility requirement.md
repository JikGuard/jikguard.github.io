The Android Developers Blog announced that, starting from 1 November 2025, all app updates submitted to Google Play targeting Android 15 and higher must support a 16 KB page size on 64-bit devices. Applications that have not been adapted to this new specification may face the risk of not running properly in the future.<!-- more -->

Previously, Android devices only supported 4 KB memory pages. However, as device memory continues to grow, 16 KB page management enables faster retrieval of the content required by the device, thereby improving device performance.

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the product's hardening and provide better service, the JikGuard technical team carried out the adaptation work as soon as possible. The hardening solution now fully supports Google Play 16k compatibility requirements, helping developers meet Google's compliance requirements.

The technical team strictly follows Google's testing specifications. After testing, games that use the JikGuard hardening solution run smoothly on 16KB devices, with no impact on performance and all security features working normally.

JikGuard Game Protection uses a carefully constructed pure native solution, conducting in-depth research on the low-level mechanisms of the system to provide a dedicated solution for games with high compatibility, high performance, and high security strength.

In the future, we will continue to pay attention to system ecology and version trends, continue to explore in the field of technology, and build technical barriers. We will work with game manufacturers to overcome game security challenges, create a more fair gaming environment, and promote the healthy development of the gaming industry.
