Steam Deck is a portable handheld gaming device developed by Valve that allows users to enjoy games from the Steam library. Additionally, the device's Steam OS supports other gaming platforms. The handheld's portability perfectly meets the needs of hardcore gamers, and its extremely high cost-effectiveness—far below the price of gaming laptops—has enabled Steam Deck to surpass the one million sales mark in the same year of its release.<!-- more -->

According to The Verge, market research firm IDC estimates that global sales of the Steam Deck have now surpassed 4 million units, far exceeding the combined total of all other Windows-based competitors, solidifying its position as the undisputed leader in the handheld PC market.

However, where there are games, there is cheating, and the Steam Deck is no exception. At its core, it creates a PC-like environment through a compatibility layer, allowing games to run on SteamOS under Linux. This means the Steam Deck also faces the same game security issues as PC games.

Various plugins targeting the Steam Deck have emerged on the market, such as Steam Tinker Launch and Memory Hack, which allow the use of Cheat Engine modifiers while running games.

The vast market size contrasts sharply with the severe security issues. To strengthen the security of games running on the Steam Deck, the following challenges must be addressed:

First is the performance issue. Compared to Windows hosts, the Steam Deck has slightly inferior performance, so there are high requirements for the performance consumption of hardening products. Second, the code needs to run with instruction escaping, which means it occupies more resources and often runs slower. Without targeted optimisation, even if the game is hardened, its performance on the Steam Deck will be poor.

Secondly, there is the issue of compatibility. In order to ensure security, game hardening involves deep processing of low-level system functions, which requires separate compatibility support for Steam Deck, which is a very time-consuming task.

JikGuard game hardening now fully supports Steam Deck through in-depth research on the SteamOS system architecture. It has also been specially optimised for performance consumption and compatibility issues, perfectly solving the above difficulties.

The hardening solution provides high-strength security protection with almost no impact on game performance, and has undergone special compatibility adaptation. It has now been integrated into many popular games and has proven its excellent protection capabilities.
