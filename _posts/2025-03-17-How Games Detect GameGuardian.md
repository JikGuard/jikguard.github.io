It has been observed that in recent years, there has been a significant trend of diversification in the angle of game black and gray industry attacks, facing a variety of security issues such as studios, custom injection cheats, auto click cheats, hack versions, memory modification cheats, and so on.<!-- more -->

According to JikGuard statistics, among the many security risks faced by the game, the “memory modification” attack accounts for about 11%, and the main way to realize it is to use memory modifiers to tamper with the game memory after obtaining high privileges.

Memory modifiers are essentially general-purpose or customized cheating tools that have the ability to find and modify memory. For example, GameGuardian is one of the most common modifiers on the market. In this article, we will analyze GameGuardian modifiers and propose solutions through real cases.

GameGuardian can provide manual memory search and modification functions. As demonstrated in the figure below, GameGuardian modifier searches the data of gold coins several times, determines the memory address of gold coins, and then tampers with it to realize the cheating function of unlimited gold coins.

In addition to its own memory search and modification, GameGuardian also has an anti-detection function, which is used to prevent being detected by the game.

▲ Demonstration of GameGuardian's anti-detection function  

It has been observed that some variants of modifiers even evade detection by stealing the package names of other applications. Undoubtedly, this increases the difficulty of detection. If the game security products do not study the modifiers deeply enough, a lot of errors will be reported in the process of detection.  

Since root permissions are required to perform memory modifications, GameGuardian often run virtual machines, virtual frameworks, and other environments. After obtaining root permissions, you can use magisk to hide the process of the game to avoid game detection, so that the traditional means of detection is ineffective, and the difficulty of the fight is greatly increased.

**JikGuard has developed a customized strategy to deal with the memory modification problem caused by GameGuardian and its variants. The solution has been applied to many popular games and has proven its excellent protection ability.**  

**Anti-Memory Modification**

JikGuard has developed a behavioral detection solution that accurately identifies memory modification and kills all kinds of modifier cheats and their variants, providing effective protection against memory modification risks faced by games.

**Security Environment Detection**

JikGuard uses underlying detection methods to accurately identify the operating environment of the game, such as jailbreak, ROOT, virtual machine, virtual framework, cloud phone, etc., and provides personalized flashback strategies.

**Magisk Detection**

JikGuard's exclusive detection program can accurately identify and perform flashing operations even if Magisk has all hidden options turned on.
