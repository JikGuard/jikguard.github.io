Mini-games, due to their high popularity and large player base, are more susceptible to disruption by game-related black and gray markets. Compared to client-based and mobile games, mini-games are easier to Hack, leading to frequent incidents of mini-game Hack in the market. Mini-games primarily face the following categories of game security issues:<!-- more --> 

**▎Mini-Game Hack**

Hack poses the primary security risk for mini-games. Hackers can use various tools to analyze and crack mini-game packages, extracting source code and resources contained within.

By retaining the game framework while replacing the art assets and advertising modules within the game package, then repackaging and relisting it, this practice severely impacts the original game developer's revenue.

**▎Game Resource Leakage**

Once a game package is Hacked, it can lead to the leakage of resources such as code, images, videos, and audio files contained within. These resources may be used for competitor analysis or even repackaged and resold, causing immeasurable damage to the game.

**▎Communication Protocol Hack**

Hackers can use packet capture tools to crack game communication protocols, disrupting normal client-server interactions to tamper with data and in-game logic. Such actions provoke dissatisfaction among legitimate players, damaging the developer's reputation and revenue streams.
