Risky environments for games are environments that are independent of the original device or disrupt the original system of the device. Common game risk environments include: iOS jailbreak, Android root, virtual machines, virtual frameworks, cloud phones and so on.<!-- more --> 

Because these types of risky environments can provide the high-level device permissions needed for game cheats and hacks, there are often greater security risks when the game is in these device environments.

The mainstream virtual framework on the market is to copy a copy of the APK to run in the virtual space through a set of virtual technologies such as virtual Framework layer, virtual file system, simulation of Android's management of components, virtual application process management and so on.

Common virtual frameworks on the market

Game cheat users can run the game in the virtual frame to achieve multi-instance operation. In addition, some virtual frames come with root permissions, which can provide an environment for game cheats/hacks.

Virtual framework multi-instance applications

Compared with virtual machines, virtual frameworks have a lower threshold, and also have the characteristics of running with less consumption and a higher degree of smoothness of the game, leading to virtual frameworks being widely used by game black and grey industry.

There are many variants of virtual frameworks, and the variants of virtual frameworks on the market can reach tens of thousands. Once a certain virtual framework cannot be detected and spreads through various channels, it will have a serious impact on the game in a short period of time.

Detecting virtual frameworks has high requirements for the detection coverage of game security products. JikGuard has customised a special response strategy for virtual frameworks and other risky environments faced by games. The solution has been accessed by a number of popular games and has proven its excellent protection capabilities.
 
**Security Risk Environment Detection**

Unlike other products on the market, JikGuard's reinforcement adopts a more low-level detection method to accurately distinguish the operating environment of games, accurately identifying all kinds of virtual frameworks and their variants, as well as all kinds of risky environments, such as virtual machines, jailbreaks, ROOT, cloud phones, etc., and providing personalised crush strategies.
