Game in-app purchase hacking refers to the act of illegally obtaining paid content or features by reverse engineering and using modification tools to tamper with or bypass the game's normal payment logic.<!-- more --> 

For a game, the consequences of hacked in-app purchases are extremely severe. Hacked versions can spread rapidly through various channels, leading to a significant loss of paying players for the legitimate version and causing severe damage to the game developer's revenue.

The most common modification tool on the market is MT Manager, which offers a suite of Hack features including DEX editing, XML editing, APK signing, signature verification removal, and RES resource deobfuscation. After obtaining root privileges, it can modify file permissions and ownership, making it widely used in hacking scenarios.

Hackers can use MT Manager to remove the game's signature verification, then search for payment channel strings to locate the relevant code. After pinpointing the target, they can use editing functions to tamper with the payment logic. Finally, by re-signing the game, they can bypass the payment system entirely, allowing them to access various in-game bundles without paying.

For games monetized through advertising, hack versions often remove or replace the ad modules. Ad-free versions hold immense appeal for players, leading to a significant exodus of legitimate users within a short period and severely impacting the game developer's revenue.

To address the risk of in-app purchase Hack in games, JikGuard has developed a specialized countermeasure. This solution has been integrated into multiple popular games and has demonstrated outstanding protection capabilities.

**Proactive Malicious Module Detection Mechanism**

Unlike other security products on the market that require obtaining samples before combating cheats, JikGuard's exclusive “Proactive Malicious Module Detection Mechanism” actively identifies suspicious modules within games. Combined with its online countermeasure capabilities, this enables proactive defense, significantly reducing the time required to investigate and eliminate cheats.

**Anti-Hack Functionality**

Utilizing JikGuard's industry-exclusive “API Signature Verification-Free Technology,” the game engine and code undergo encryption processing. This enables multi-layered verification of game package signatures and file integrity, preventing the injection of malicious modules, removal of advertisements, and other unauthorized modifications.

**Anti-Debugging Feature**

Prevents Cheats authors from debugging the game and blocks static or dynamic analysis. Upon detection, the game will immediately crash.

**Security Environment Detection Function**

Unlike other products on the market, JikGuard employs deeper-level detection methods to accurately identify various risky environments such as virtual frameworks, virtual machines, jailbreaks, root access, and cloud phones, while providing customized crash prevention strategies.
