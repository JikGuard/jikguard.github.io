The game needs to play the screen in frames while running, and to calculate the time required to play each frame of animation, it needs to call the C library function to obtain the system time. For example:<!-- more -->

// gettimeofday;
// clock_gettime;

The principle of speed hack implementation is to speed up or slow down the flow of time in the game by modifying the obtained system time.

In addition to the common method of calling the system time, some speed hacks can also achieve speed changes by calling the time within the game engine. For example, by calling UnityEngine_Time_set_timeScale and passing in the desired speed factor, a global speed effect can be achieved.

Depending on the gameplay, speed hacks can have different effects. For example, rhythm game and action game can be made significantly easier by slowing down the speed.

Slowing down the speed reduces the difficulty of music games

In racing and simulation games, speed can be increased to accelerate progress and obtain game rewards.

Accelerate task completion by increasing speed

These types of cheats seriously undermine the fairness of the game and cause dissatisfaction among normal players. If not stopped, they can drastically shorten the game's life cycle.

JikGuard has customised a special response strategy to address the problem of speed hacks in games. This solution has been integrated into many popular games and has proven its excellent protection capabilities.
 
**Speed hack crush feature**

Using more low-level detection methods and extensive real-machine testing, it can accurately detect any speed hacks and their variants. Once a speed hack is detected, the game will immediately crash.
 
**Anti engine-level speed hack**

It goes deep into the low-level game engine to perform in-depth detection of engine-level speed hacks and obtain specific speed hack multiples, enabling accurate account suspension or crash handling.
