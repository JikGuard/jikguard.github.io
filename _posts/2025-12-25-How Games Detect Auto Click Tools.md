Auto click is a technique that mimics user clicks through scripts, system commands, or programming code to enable automated operations. Initially widely used in automated testing and accessibility scenarios, this technology has been exploited by Game Black/Gray Industry as it evolved. It has since infiltrated gaming, social media, live streaming, and other platforms, causing significant disruptions.<!-- more --> 

In gaming scenarios, auto click severely disrupts game balance, leading to a series of serious consequences. This article analyzes the principles of auto click and detection solutions through practical case studies.

Game auto click tools allow users to create scripts by configuring parameters such as button positions, click sequences, and interval times. In specific game scenarios, switching between scripts enables automated features like clearing levels, completing quests, and collecting rewards. Auto click hacks significantly disrupt game balance and undermine the gaming experience for legitimate players.

There are also specialized third-party software solutions that can simulate user actions by writing scripts through the AccessibilityService, without requiring root privileges.

There are numerous tools of this kind, with a considerable number of variants, posing a significant challenge to the detection coverage of game security products. Should any tool go undetected, it can rapidly spread through various channels, causing severe negative consequences.

With technological advancements, the proportion of private auto click scripts has significantly increased. These private scripts employ various methods to disguise themselves as legitimate players to evade game detection. Distinguishing between bot farms and genuine players based solely on gameplay behavior undoubtedly complicates detection efforts.
