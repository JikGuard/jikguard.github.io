As we all know, under the unique closed-source ecosystem of iOS, the only official app download channel is the App Store, and app downloads will go through layers of auditing and testing to ensure its security and stability, and unaudited apps will not be downloaded to the phone.<!-- more -->  

This initiative restricts the possibility of users obtaining unofficial or hacked apps. Compared with the open source Android system, the security risk faced by games under iOS system will be reduced, but it also leads to the fact that some companies take it lightly and ignore the security issue in the process of developing the iOS terminal.

As a common means of cheating on the iOS side - iOS jailbreaking. iOS devices can be jailbroken after a series of operations, which allows users to obtain the highest permissions of the operating system, and can be used to install extensions other than the App Store through software such as Cydia Manager, which provides convenience for game cheats and hacks.

After the device is jailbroken, the jailbroken device can be identified through a variety of dimensional data judgment, and targeted combat. In addition, jailbreaking can also lead to system stability problems, such as application flashback, lagging, and even lead to the device's firmware damage and loss of warranty eligibility.

In the context of jailbreaking is easy to be detected, and there are stability problems, some developers based on iOS system loopholes, developed a jailbreak-free cheat - iOS TrollStore.

Trollstore utilizes the CoreTrust vulnerability that exists in the iOS system that bypasses signature verification to achieve external app installation without signature, no expiration limit, no flashbacks and other issues. Users can install and use apps that have not been reviewed by the App Store without jailbreaking.

Trollstore can be installed by the rapid deployment tool TrollInstallerX, which utilizes the kfd kernel vulnerability and the dmaFail PPL bypass technology, supports system versions from iOS 14.0 to 16.6.1, and is able to install the Trollstore and install it directly on the phone without replacing the system-level apps.

Users can deploy Trollstore by connecting their phone via i4Assistant, signing and installing TrollInstallerX, and then setting the app as trusted in Settings.

After installing Trollstore, users can download the ipa installation package through various channels to realize the installation of external applications at will. This kind of cheat is utilized by the game black industry to spread game hacks and game cheats, which has a serious impact on many games.

The proliferation of Trollstore has led to the frequent occurrence of iOS game security problems, especially in the current trend of game interoperability, the game as a whole, no matter which end of the game cheating problems, will cause more serious impact than ever.
