According to JikGuard's observations, attacks from the black and gray industries have become increasingly diverse in recent years. This is mainly reflected in the fact that a game faces a wide variety of security issues, and the black and gray industries will launch attacks on games from many angles to make a profit.<!-- more -->

Hackers will use a combination of static analysis and dynamic debugging to reverse engineer the game, decrypt the game code logic, and then modify the game code logic to create a "pirated version".

Hacked games come with a series of modified features

Compared to cheats, hacking has a more severe impact on games. Hacked games often come with a series of modified features that seriously disrupt the balance of the game, resulting in a large loss of legitimate players and damage to the manufacturer's revenue.

In addition, hacking also means that the game code and resources are analysed, which can cause operational accidents due to the leakage of game resources, and there is also the possibility of plagiarism by competing products.

In this article, we will analyse the features and principles of the reverse engineering tool "MT Manager" through case studies and provide solutions for game hacking.

MT Manager is a reverse engineering modification tool software on the Android platform with unique dual-window file management and powerful APK editing features, which can efficiently perform various file operations and modify Android software.

After obtaining root permissions, MT Manager can access the system directory, mount the file system for reading and writing, and modify file permissions and owners. Its main features are APK editing, including DEX editing, XML editing, APK signing, signature verification removal, RES resource obfuscation, etc.

JikGuard has customised a special response strategy to address the problem of game hacking. This solution has been integrated into many popular games and has proven its excellent protection capabilities.

**Anti-hacking features**

JikGuard uses its exclusive "API-Free signature verification technology" to encrypt the game engine and code from the low-level, performing multiple checks on game package signatures and file integrity to prevent malicious modules from being implanted in the game and remove advertisements.

**Anti-memory modification features**

In response to the risk of memory modification faced by games, JikGuard has devoted itself to the research and development of a "behaviour detection solution". Through a sensitive intelligent perception system, once a modification is detected, it can immediately crush the game, detect various types of modification cheats and their variants, and provide effective protection.

**Resource encryption features**

JikGuard's exclusive resource encryption solution goes deep into the low-level game engine and is carefully constructed based on the game resource file structure and loading mechanism.

It provides high-strength encryption protection for games, with high compatibility, low running consumption, and no impact on performance. It supports Android/iOS/PC and other platforms, as well as online resource updates.

In addition, the solution has been specially optimised, eliminating the need for development docking and access, and making encryption and decryption transparent to developers.
